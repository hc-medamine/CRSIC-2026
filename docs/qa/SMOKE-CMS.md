# Smoke checklist — CRSIC internal CMS

Run on branch `feature/step4-internal-cms` with Postgres up and `cd cms && npm run dev`.  
Use **two accounts** (four-eyes): one Editor (or Super Admin as author) and a **different** Reviewer.

Estimated time: **~10 minutes**.

**Danger:** Publishing from CMS **replaces** the matching public JSON with CMS-published items only (writes `.bak` first). Prefer smoke items you will unpublish, or restore from `.bak` afterward.

## I. Completion gaps (Phase 1)

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|--------|-------|
| I1 | `/dashboard` shows queues: Awaiting review, Needs revision, My drafts, Rejected, **Unpublished**, Recently published; rows link to the right detail page | ☐ |
| I2 | Each detail form shows the **Public card preview (P1)** near Publish (news img/label/title; event date/title/type/status; pub cover/title/type/dept/desc) | ☐ |
| I3 | Chrome **language toggle** flips AR RTL ↔ EN LTR, nav labels localise, and the choice survives a reload (`cms_lang` cookie) | ☐ |
| I4 | On a **published** item: “Create revision (public stays live)” → status `draft`, but public JSON still contains the item (unchanged) | ☐ |
| I5 | Edit → submit → (other) approve → publish the revision → public JSON updates; item is not duplicated | ☐ |
| I6 | Reviewer/Super Admin: **Restore this revision** in revision history sets fields back + status `draft`; audit `*.restore_revision` | ☐ |
| I7 | Super Admin/Reviewer: **Reassign author** on a draft/changes_requested/submitted item; audit `content.reassign`; new author notified | ☐ |
| I8 | Cutover: `npm run db:import-legacy` imports current JSON as live items (idempotent; publications keep `covers.length === pubs.length`); does **not** rewrite `data/*.json` | ☐ |
| I9 | After unpublish (or reject): item appears in **Unpublished** / **Rejected** on dashboard for author + Reviewer/SA (Editors: own or scoped). Super Admin only: **Delete permanently** on unpublished/rejected; audit `*.delete` | ☐ |

CMS Phase 1 is on `main`. Further CMS work ships on feature branches (e.g. detail-page schema).
